Run SmilingWolfs [wd-convnext-tagger-v3](https://huggingface.co/SmilingWolf/wd-convnext-tagger-v3) model on mobile!

## ðŸŽ‰ Google Play Closed Beta
The app is currently in closed beta and needs testers! You can join the beta [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.kuzulabz.WaifuTagger) or from the Google Play button above. 

*Due to new Google Play policies, 20 testers are needed for 14 days before the app can go public.*

## ðŸŽ® Platforms
Android is currently supported! 

I think iOS could easily be supported but I haven't tested it. Same goes for web.

## ðŸ¤— Model
To run the model on mobile, I quantized it and added preprocessing using [onnxruntime-extentions](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/extensions/). This model is available on my [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Smashinfries/wd-convnext-tagger-v3-mobile). You can also find more details about the process there.

## ðŸŽ¯ Model Accuracy
If you get bad results, it's highly likely that I did something wrong with the preprocessing. Any tips for improvement would be appreciated.
